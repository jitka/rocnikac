This thesis describes an algorithm for solving strong positional games
with high symmetry. We describe the most important algorithm for solving 
combinatorial games -- PN-search and its various enhancements, which change
it so much, that they can be considered new algorithms. 

\medskip

PN-search was introduced by Allis in 1994\cite{allis}. It has become well a know algorithm
and a basis for a~lot of further work. It was successfully applied for a~wide class
of games, and many enhancements were invented. We review some of them and how they can be useful
in case of a~game with high symmetry. We consider which  enhancements
can be used together and what problems can arise with these combinations.
We also introduce some enhancements which we discovered independently.

\subsubsection{Outline}

In the first chapter, we informally introduce some combinatorial
game terminology. We suppose the reader has general knowledge about graph theory, 
see Diestel~\cite{ramsey}. In the first chapter we also define clique game and give
solutions of some cases of a~clique game.

Known algorithms and their enhancements are introduced in the second chapter. Usually,
algorithms are designed for a general combinatorial game. We apply them to
strong positional games, which simplifies the descriptions. We start with a~game 
solving meta algorithm. Some specific algorithms are described after. We choose PN-search to
implement and to be described in detail.

Theoretical results, which we found independently, are described in the third chapter.
In subsections~\ref{ord} to~\ref{lastenh2} are enhancements of PN-search. Then we introduce some rules for
deleting from the cache which are designed for strong positional games. We consider
a~problem which can occur when we combine some enhancements, and we
propose a~solution for the problem. In the end of the chapter, we focus on
a~graph of a~clique game. We describe several ways of storing
the game state and also how to normalize them.

The last chapter introduces our software and presents experimental results.
First, we describe the partial game tree created by our solver during solving
(6,4) and (7,4)-clique games. Then we compare some mentioned enhancements. In the 
end of the chapter, we describe the software implementation in more detail.
